Welcome to the CS 106B/X Game of Life!
This program simulates the lifecycle of a bacterial colony.
Cells (X) live and die by the following rules:
* A cell with 1 or fewer neighbors dies.
* Locations with 2 neighbors remain stable.
* Locations with 3 neighbors will create life.
* A cell with 4 or more neighbors dies.

This is a bug I encontered when trying to display grid in LifeGUI. I tried to test if I didn't
resize the gui properly. The problem was actually I need to resize the gui after I initialize the LifeGUI.
After I resize the LifeGUI, the error went away!
